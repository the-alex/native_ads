            <h2>Jim Harbaugh Continues To Do Bizarre Things In His Quest To Land Recruits</h2>
            <img class="alignright" src="images/harb.jpg">
            <p>The last time we checked in on the unconventional recruiting tactics of Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh, he had just managed to talk his way into a sleepover at the house of the No. 1 kicking prospect in the country. This was supposed to happen late last week, and now that that's over, Harbaugh brought his delightful weirdness to California in an attempt to pull in a highly-sought after defensive lineman.</p>
            <p>Harbaugh traveled out to De La Salle High School in Concord, California to meet up with four-star defensive tackle Boss Tagaloa, who holds offers from 15 schools and is the 107th-best player in the nation, according to 247 Sports. Usually when a coach goes to a high school to meet up with a player, it's a short visit that is continued at the player's house later that day. But for Harbaugh, it's much more than that, as he decided it would be fun to go to class with Tagaloa.</p>
            <p>And just in case you think that this was a stunt where the two went into an empty classroom, one of Tagaloa's teachers took to Facebook and discussed having Harbaugh in her class.</p>
            <p>The bad news for Harbaugh is that Tagaloa's Crystal Ball doesn't include the Wolverines â€“ it projects that he's either headed to UCLA or Washington. Still, this is a fun way for Harbaugh to show that he'll go to any lengths to woo a recruit. At the very least, Harbaugh got the chance to sit in on a World Religions lesson that he found fascinating, which is nice.</p>
            <p>Oh, by the way: National Signing Day is 15 days away, so there's still plenty of time for Harbaugh to do something even weirder than having a sleepover at a recruit's house or shadowing a recruit as he goes through a school day. We have no idea what that thing would be, but we guarantee that if it happens, it will be silly and get across the message that Harbaugh is an ace recruiter.</p>
