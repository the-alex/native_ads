            <h2>Trooper comforts children after Halloween tragedy</h2>
            <img class="alignright" src="images/tragic.jpg" alt="">
            <p>A Georgia State Patrol Trooper went above and beyond the call of duty after a Halloween tragedy.</p>

<p>Four Morgan County children lost both of their parents as they were getting ready to trick or treat Saturday.</p>

<p>Donald and Crystal Howard left their home in Newborn to buy face paint and Halloween candy. They were killed instantly when their SUV flew off the road and hit a tree.</p>

<p>Trooper Nathan Bradley arrived at the home to break the news of the tragedy.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I was greeted by four children in full costumes,” Bradley said.</p>

<p>With their grandmother’s permission, Bradley didn’t tell the children, who ranged in age from 6 to 13, that their parents had died.</p>

<p>“The first thing I said was, ‘Hey lets go get something to eat,’” Bradley said.  “They said, ‘My parents will be here soon.’ I said, ‘Your Grandma wants you to hang out with me till she gets here.;”</p>

<p>Bradley treated Justin, Amaya, Damien and Travion to dinner, movies and Halloween candy at the Monroe State Patrol post followed by a sleepover.</p>

<p>“The whole purpose was to preserve their Halloween,” said Bradley said.</p>

<p>They weren't told about their parents’ accident until the next morning when their grandmother arrived.</p>

<p>Bradley also started a GoFundMe page for funeral expenses so that Crystal and Donald can be buried in Florida, where the children are moving in with grandparents.</p>

<p>All the kindness came from a young state trooper who didn't want to ruin Halloween for his four new friends.</p>

<p>"It’s the first time in the line of duty I told someone I loved them and I do love them," Bradley said. "I care about them a lot."</p>
