            <h2>Netflix CEO reveals how much vacation he takes, and it's a lot more than most people take off</h2>
            <img src="images/netflix.jpg">
            <p>At Tuesday's DealBook conference, organized by The New York Times, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said he took a full six weeks of vacation per year and it was "helpful." He said he was "open about it internally, to try to set a good example."</p>

<p>Netflix doesn't have a vacation policy, according to its widely circulated culture deck, opting instead for "unlimited" vacation time. (Business Insider offers the same policy.)</p>

<p>This practice has been both lauded and widely criticized because it leaves employees confused as to how much vacation time they should actually take. As a result, they could end up taking much less than they would if there were specific guidelines in place — something Hastings acknowledged at the conference.</p>

<p>The same logic applies to Netflix's recent announcement that it would offer unlimited parental leave within the first year of employees' parenthood.</p>

<p>But Hastings' revelation suggests that at least some execs really do encourage their employees to take time off by setting a precedent.</p>

<p>"Netflix leaders set good examples by taking big vacations — and coming back inspired to find big ideas," one slide in the culture deck reads. Apparently, Hastings wasn't just theorizing.</p>

<p>According to one study, in 2013 American employees took an average of 16 days of vacation, down from about 20 in 2000. Another survey found that 72% of senior managers said that even if their companies offered unlimited vacation days, they wouldn't use any more than they had been.</p>

<p>Netflix doesn't track its employees' vacation time, Hastings confirmed at the conference. But in 2011 a spokesman told The Wall Street Journal that Netflix staffers took about three to five weeks off a year.</p>

<p>Research suggests that taking periodic vacations can boost employees' productivity, concentration, and overall satisfaction at work.</p>

<p>"Just as you would expect, you often do your best thinking [when] you're off hiking in some mountain," Hastings told Andrew Ross Sorkin, New York Times columnist and DealBook founder. "You get a different perspective on something."</p>
