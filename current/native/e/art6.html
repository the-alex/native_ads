            <h2>Five Students Stabbed and the Suspect Killed in University of California Stabbing</h2>
            <img class="alignright" src="images/stabbed.jpg">
            <p>Five people were stabbed Wednesday at the University of California, Merced in a campus rampage that ended with the suspect dead.</p>

<p>All of the injured, at least some of whom were students, were conscious following the 8 a.m. attack, according to a school press release. However, two of the victims were taken to a hospital by helicopter. </p>

<p>The extent of their injuries were not immediately known.</p>

<p>The suspect was shot by police shortly before 9 a.m. and subsequently died of his injuries.</p>

<p>The school announced on Twitter that all classes were canceled and warned students and staff not to enter the campus.</p>

<p>"Campus police report suspect shot and killed. 5 students have been treated for stab wounds. Campus remains closed. Classes canceled," UC Merced tweeted.</p>
