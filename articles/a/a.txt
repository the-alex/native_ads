BODY :: 
Zynga CFO David Lee is stepping down, effective immediately, the gaming company reported in its Q3 earnings. 
Zynga did not provide a reason for the abrupt change.

Lee, who joined the company in April 2014, will be temporarily replaced by interim CFO Michelle Quejado, who was formerly the company's chief accounting officer. 

The company, most famous for its FarmVille and Words With Friends franchises, beat analyst estimates on both the top and bottom line, with revenue of $196 million and break-even non-GAAP EPS.

Zynga also said that a key metric — average monthly active users — declined by 27% year-over-year during the third quarter (compared to 32% year-over-year decline in Q2). 

The stock was up as much as ~2% after-hours, but is now more or less flat.

This change comes about six months after founder Mark Pincus returned from a two year hiatus to take the company's helm as CEO. 

Pincus highlighted a few "key intiatives," that Lee had spearheaded since, including a $100 million cost reduction program, the company's transition to mobile, and a $200 millino stock buyback program that the company had just announced.
