MORGAN COUNTY, Ga. – A Georgia State Patrol Trooper went above and beyond the call of duty after a Halloween tragedy.

Four Morgan County children lost both of their parents as they were getting ready to trick or treat Saturday.

Donald and Crystal Howard left their home in Newborn to buy face paint and Halloween candy. They were killed instantly when their SUV flew off the road and hit a tree.

Trooper Nathan Bradley arrived at the home to break the news of the tragedy.

Unfortunately, I was greeted by four children in full costumes,” Bradley said.

With their grandmother’s permission, Bradley didn’t tell the children, who ranged in age from 6 to 13, that their parents had died.

“The first thing I said was, ‘Hey lets go get something to eat,’” Bradley said.  “They said, ‘My parents will be here soon.’ I said, ‘Your Grandma wants you to hang out with me till she gets here.;”

Bradley treated Justin, Amaya, Damien and Travion to dinner, movies and Halloween candy at the Monroe State Patrol post followed by a sleepover.

“The whole purpose was to preserve their Halloween,” said Bradley said.

They weren't told about their parents’ accident until the next morning when their grandmother arrived.

Bradley also started a GoFundMe page for funeral expenses so that Crystal and Donald can be buried in Florida, where the children are moving in with grandparents.

All the kindness came from a young state trooper who didn't want to ruin Halloween for his four new friends.

“It’s the first time in the line of duty I told someone I loved them and I do love them,” Bradley said. “I care about them a lot.”
